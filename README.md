Simply press the button and the display shows the current ETH value (in £).  The second button will display BTC (in £)

Next time you press either button the display will compare the current value with the previous.  If the value has increased the display will turn green, if the value has decreased the display will change to red.  Orange denotes that the value is the same as when you last checked.

The display also shows the current date and time for reference.
